Next generation DNA sequencing technologies have reduced the cost and increased the throughput of sequence data. Gone are the days when sequencing was possible only in large genome sequence facilities. It is now accessible, not only to almost all biology labs, but to the public as well. With this accessibility of technologies and availability of genomics data, Computational Biology/Bioinformatics has become an integral and indispensable part of life sciences over the past decade but still very challenging in terms of integrating bioinformatics teaching and research at the undergraduate and graduate level at any higher educational institution.

In this proposal we want to establish a Computational Biology and Applied Bioinformatics (CoBaAB) Laboratory whose mission will be tri-fold,

1.	Mission 1 (Collaboration): Institute a collaboration with faculties from relevant departments, centers, and labs at DePaul University.

2.	Mission 2 (Teaching/Outreach): Establish collaborations with Community Colleges and High School students and setup summer programs where students can visit DePaul University to participate in this program. Also faculty will organize trips to schools to conduct seminars and bioinformatics summer camps.

3.	Mission 3 (Research): Lastly, the lab will serve as a nucleus for fostering bioinformatics research collaboration between faculties at CDM, other units at DePaul University and also with other academic, research institutions and companies in and around Chicagoland. 

CoBaAB will be the first of its kind at DePaul University. We are perfectly positioned in the loop at SoC, CDM, DePaul University with all of the resources in terms of an active student body, diverse faculty interests and a thriving Bioinformatics industry.
